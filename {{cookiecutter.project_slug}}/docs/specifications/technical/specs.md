# Technical Specifications

**Summary:** This document provides the detailed technical specifications required to implement the functional requirements. It covers the technology stack, data models, system architecture, and non-functional requirements.

## 1. Technology Stack

| Component         | Technology        | Version | Justification                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend          | React             | 18.x    | Component-based architecture, strong ecosystem. |
| Backend           | Python (FastAPI)  | 3.11    | High performance, async support, type hints.  |
| Database          | PostgreSQL        | 15      | ACID compliance, scalability, JSONB support.|
| Cache             | Redis             | 7.x     | In-memory data store for high-speed access. |
| Containerization  | Docker            | 20.10   | Consistent environments, easy deployment.   |
| Orchestration     | Kubernetes        | 1.27    | Scalability, resilience, and service discovery. |

## 2. System Architecture

Our system follows a microservices architecture. For a visual representation, please refer to the [High-Level Architecture Diagram](../../architecture/high-level/diagram.md).

### Key Components:
- **API Gateway:** Single entry point for all client requests.
- **Authentication Service:** Manages user identity and access control.
- **Data Processing Service:** Handles asynchronous jobs and data aggregation.
- **Notification Service:** Manages email, SMS, and push notifications.

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1. `users` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3.2. `projects` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Performance
- All API endpoints must respond in under 500ms (p95).
- The system must support 1,000 concurrent users with no degradation in performance.

### 4.2. Security
- All data in transit must be encrypted with TLS 1.3.
- All sensitive data at rest must be encrypted using AES-256.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing are required.

### 4.3. Scalability
- The system must be horizontally scalable.
- Automated scaling policies should be in place to handle traffic spikes.
